# Orb Browser
Another proof-of-concept browser written in Electron!

Orb is another browser inspired by the original (Cascade) but with more functionality, features, and a better backend system.

Orb is written in Electron and contains basic Widevine DRM support (Windows/macOS?) and also may have partial Chrome extension support.

## What can Orb actually do?
It can do almost everything Cascade can do:
- Back/forward and reload navigation
- Various keybinds (Ctrl+R, Ctrl+Shift+R, Ctrl+P, Ctrl+W, Ctrl+T)
- Tab creation and destruction, as well as loading favicons
- Basic support for context menus (e.g. Inspect, Select All)
- Save tabs on exit, so it loads them on next load
- Smart URL bar (direct URL, search, etc.)
- Widevine DRM support (Windows/macOS)
- Pinned tabs *

However, it can also do these new extra features (ones with * are planned):
- Ultimate Omnibox! (popup, search suggestions)
- Tab folders *
- Basic Chrome extension support *
- Better navigation system
- Cached favicons (cold URL loading) *
- Animations!
- Improved design
